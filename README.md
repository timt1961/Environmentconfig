# Environmentconfig
Convenience settings for my environment


2022-02-21 : Rewrote my bashrc
  - Added a timestamp to the PS1 prompt
  - Discovered that git_completion and git_prompt are part of the standard
    git distro these days, so decided to use the system version
  - reorganized aliases and functions
  - added .tmux.conf
  - *NOTE* The emacs config is outdated; guess I'll hit that next
